This project contains a client end code, so as to simulate a Multi-Thread Banking System.
In the digital age, banking systems are expected to handle multiple users 
concurrently while ensuring the integrity of financial transactions. The challenge is 
to design and simulate a Multi-Thread Banking System where numerous users can 
concurrently access and perform operations on their accounts. The primary objective 
is to prevent inconsistencies during concurrent transactions and to provide a robust, 
secure, and efficient banking experience.
Constraints of Multi-Thread Banking System:
Concurrency Complexity:
Simulating realistic concurrent scenarios can be intricate, as it involves accurately 
modeling the complexities of real-world user interactions and their impact on data 
consistency.
Performance Overhead:
Introducing multi-threading can lead to increased performance overhead due to 
synchronization mechanisms, potentially impacting the system's responsiveness.
Data Integrity Challenges:
Ensuring data consistency and integrity during concurrent transactions may require 
sophisticated concurrency control mechanisms, adding complexity to the system.
Resource Utilization:
Managing resources efficiently in a multi-threaded environment is crucial. 
Inefficient resource utilization may result in bottlenecks and hinder overall system 
performance.
